Note to self!

This is a loose collection of resource references that I have found useful, interesting or simply amusing.
The subject areas reflect my work, research, educational and recreational activities.

I'm putting them on github so that I can find them all in one place when I need to reference them myself or refer a friend or colleague to something them might find useful or amusing.

If they are of use to anyone else then that is ok by me.
